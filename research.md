<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Manipulation of behaviorally-relevant neural circuits</u></i><br>
I use viral targeting and expression of proteins such as DREADD receptors and opsins to causally link projection-specific circuits with distinct aspects of learning, memory, and decision making (e.g., hippocampal neurons with projections to the prefrontal cortex with emotional memory recall in the above image).</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Assessment of oscillatory synchrony in neural circuits during behavior</u></i><br>
I use <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology to record local field potentials from multiple anatomically-connected brain regions during behavior, and analyze information flow between these regions to understand how they communicate with one another during learning and memory-guided behavior (in the above image, theta oscillations in the hippocampus and gamma oscillations in the prefrontal cortex interact with one another during emotional memory retrieval, and this interaction is disrupted following manipulation of genetically-defined neurons in the hippocampus).</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Characterization of behaviorally-specific patterns of neuronal activity during learning and memory</u></i><br>
I use <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging to observe activity in large populations of neurons in behaving animals, and relate activity to meaningful behavior during tasks designed to probe learning and memory (see above image of calcium activity in a population of prefrontal cortex neurons from one animal; calcium activity during memory-specific behavior (freezing) changes as a function of whether the animal is forming, recalling, or extinguishing a memory).</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Identification of genetic regulators of circuit function during behavior</u></i><br>
I use viral circuit tracing in combination with tools like single-molecule <i>in situ</i> hybridization and RNA-sequencing to identify patterns of activity-dependent gene expression in specific circuits (<i>tdTomato</i>-expressing hippocampal-to-prefrontal projection neurons in the above image) following behavior.</span></div><br>
