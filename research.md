<div style="text-align:left"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';">We make decisions every day. These decisions rely on current information – what we see, hear, and feel. Our decisions also rely on our past experiences, or memories. Even something as trivial as deciding to turn at a traffic light depends attention to the “now” (i.e., the light is “green”) and memory of where we are going (i.e., the grocery store is on this road). Yet, we don’t understand how our brains integrate this information to inform our decisions. Our lack of understanding is particularly troubling given that patients with devastating mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and major depressive disorder, all have dramatic impairments in attention and memory.</span></div>

<div style="text-align:left"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';">A striking principle of brain organization is that it has modularity. Damage to anatomically discrete brain areas often results in specific cognitive deficits – for example, hippocampal damage impairs episodic memory, while damage to the basal ganglia impairs habit formation. At the same time, many brain areas also support multiple cognitive functions – for example, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a role in both attention and memory. How can the architecture of the brain be both modular and distributed? Much recent research has shown that connections <i>between</i> brain areas are what drive specific cognitive functions, like attention and memory. The PFC in particular receives contact from both attention and memory “centers” in other parts of the brain. These findings set up an important research question with opposing, testable hypotheses. One hypothesis is that different groups of neurons with different connections in the PFC support attention and memory. The alternative hypothesis is that the same groups of PFC neurons can support both attention and memory, regardless of their connections. To tacke this question, my research program uses touchscreen-based behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, viral targeting of genetically-defined neuronal subtypes, and chemogenetic excitation/inhibition in rodents.</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Assessment of oscillatory synchrony in neural circuits during behavior</u></i><br><br>
I use <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology to record local field potentials from multiple anatomically-connected brain regions during behavior, and analyze information flow between these regions to understand how they communicate with one another during learning and memory-guided behavior (in the above image, theta oscillations in the hippocampus and gamma oscillations in the prefrontal cortex interact with one another during emotional memory retrieval, and this interaction is disrupted following manipulation of genetically-defined neurons in the hippocampus).</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Characterization of behaviorally-specific patterns of neuronal activity during learning and memory</u></i><br><br>
I use <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging to observe activity in large populations of neurons in behaving animals, and relate activity to meaningful behavior during tasks designed to probe learning and memory (see above image of calcium activity in a population of prefrontal cortex neurons from one animal; calcium activity during memory-specific behavior (freezing) changes as a function of whether the animal is forming, recalling, or extinguishing a memory).</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Identification of molecular regulators of circuit function during behavior</u></i><br><br>
I use viral circuit tracing in combination with tools like single-molecule <i>in situ</i> hybridization and RNA-sequencing to identify patterns of activity-dependent gene expression in specific circuits (<i>tdTomato</i>-expressing hippocampal-to-prefrontal projection neurons in the above image) following behavior.</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Manipulation of molecular regulators within relevant circuits to affect behavior</u></i><br><br>
I use viral targeting approaches to disrupt expression and/or over-express specific molecules within neural circuits to understand how these molecules causally contribute to learning and memory-guided behavior (above image shows that over-expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampal-to-prefrontal projection neurons restores aberrant emotional memory retrieval in a special type of mutant mouse).</span></div><br>
