<div style="text-align:left"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';">We make decisions every day. These decisions rely on current information – what we see, hear, and feel. Our decisions also rely on our past experiences, or memories. Even something as trivial as deciding to turn at a traffic light depends attention to the “now” (i.e., the light is “green”) and memory of where we are going (i.e., the grocery store is on this road). Yet, we don’t understand how our brains integrate this information to inform our decisions. Our lack of understanding is particularly troubling given that patients with devastating mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and major depressive disorder, all have dramatic impairments in attention and memory.</span></div>

<div style="text-align:left"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';">A striking principle of brain organization is that it has modularity. Damage to anatomically discrete brain areas often results in specific cognitive deficits – for example, hippocampal damage impairs episodic memory, while damage to the basal ganglia impairs habit formation. At the same time, many brain areas also support multiple cognitive functions – for example, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a role in both attention and memory. How can the architecture of the brain be both modular and distributed? Much recent research has shown that connections <i>between</i> brain areas are what drive specific cognitive functions, like attention and memory. The PFC in particular receives contact from both attention and memory “centers” in other parts of the brain. These findings set up an important research question with opposing, testable hypotheses. One hypothesis is that different groups of neurons with different connections in the PFC support attention and memory. The alternative hypothesis is that the same groups of PFC neurons can support both attention and memory, regardless of their connections. To tacke this question, my research program uses touchscreen-based behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, viral targeting of genetically-defined neuronal subtypes, and chemogenetic excitation/inhibition in rodents.</span></div><br>
