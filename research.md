<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Identifying genetic regulators of circuit function during behavior</u></i><br><br>
I use viral circuit tracing in combination with tools like single-molecule <i>in situ</i> hybridization and RNA-sequencing to identify patterns of activity-dependent gene expression in specific circuits (<i>tdTomato</i>-expressing hippocampal-to-prefrontal projection neurons in the above image) following behavior.</span></div><br>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><u>Characterizing behaviorally-specific patterns of neuronal activity during learning and memory</u></i><br><br>
I use <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging and electrophysiology to observe activity in large populations of neurons in behaving animals, and relate activity to meaningful behavior during tasks designed to probe learning and memory (see above image of calcium activity in a population of prefrontal cortex neurons from one animal; calcium activity during memory-specific behavior (freezing) changes as a function of whether the animal is forming, recalling, or extinguishing a memory).</span></div><br>
