<span style="font-size:1.2em; font-family:sans-serif;">I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [<font color="blue">Keri Martinowich</font>](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/56) at [<font color="blue">The Lieber Institute for Brain Development</font>](http://www.libd.org) at The Johns Hopkins Medical Campus. I am broadly interested in how neural circuits (groups of neurons that communicate with each other) regulate learning, memory, and decision making. My aim is to discover patterns of activity that can be used to understand how neural circuits drive learning and memory-guided behavior in the normal brain, and use this information to identify novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of learning and memory-associated symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

I attained my Ph.D. in Behavioral Neuroscience from [<font color="blue">The University of Delaware</font>](https://www.psych.udel.edu/graduate/areas-of-study/behavioral-neuroscience) in 2016. My thesis work in the lab of [<font color="blue">Amy Griffin</font>](http://griffinlab.psych.udel.edu/) centered on circuit mechanisms underlying spatial working memory, a cognitive domain that is often affected in patients with schizophrenia.</span>
