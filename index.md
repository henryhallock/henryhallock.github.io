<span style="font-size:1.2em; font-family:sans-serif;">I am an assistant professor in the [<font color="blue">Neuroscience program</font>](https://neuroscience.lafayette.edu/) at Lafayette College. Our lab is broadly interested in how neural circuits (groups of neurons that communicate with each other) regulate learning, memory, and attention. Our aim is to discover patterns of activity that can be used to understand how neural circuits drive memory and attention-guided behavior in the normal brain, and use this information to identify novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of memory and attention-associated symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

I attained my Ph.D. in Behavioral Neuroscience from [<font color="blue">The University of Delaware</font>](https://www.psych.udel.edu/graduate/areas-of-study/behavioral-neuroscience) in 2016. My thesis work in the lab of [<font color="blue">Amy Griffin</font>](https://amygriff1.wixsite.com/website) centered on circuit mechanisms underlying spatial working memory, a cognitive domain that is often affected in patients with schizophrenia. I subsequently relocated to [<font color="blue">The Lieber Institute for Brain Development</font>](https://www.libd.org) in Baltimore, where I spent five years as a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [<font color="blue">Keri Martinowich</font>](https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/56). As a postdoc, I focused on understanding how gene transcription in these circuits is modified during translationally-relevant behaviors in mice.</span>
