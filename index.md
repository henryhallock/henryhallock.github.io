<span style="font-size:1.2em; font-family:sans-serif;">I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Keri Martinowich](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/56) at [The Lieber Institute for Brain Development](http://www.libd.org) at The Johns Hopkins Medical Campus. I am broadly interested in how neural circuits (groups of neurons that communicate with each other) regulate learning, memory, and decision making. My aim is to discover patterns of activity that can be used to understand how neural circuits drive learning and memory-guided behavior in the normal brain, and use this information to identify novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of learning and memory-associated symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.</span>
